# Book One

- Targeting a two hour set
- Divided into 8 moods of each 15 minutes
- Each mood needs 1 - 2 tracks
- Each 15 minute section should (1) transition the moods smoothly; and (2) contain its own sub-narrative.

## Hi-level Mood trajectory
1. Frozen Stillness - (isolation · suspended grief · quiet emptiness)
1. Playful Escape - (wonder · denial · kinetic joy)  
1. Haunted Realization - (shock · survivor’s guilt · quiet devastation)
1. Constant Pressure - (anxiety · pursuit · rising tension)
1. Growing Resolve - (determination · discipline · emotional friction)
1. Spiritual Weight - (awe · fear · cosmic loneliness)
1. Grief Transformed into Force - (rage · sorrow · elemental fury)
1. Quiet Aftermath - (somber hope · unresolved fear · forward motion)

## Mapping the moods to musical states
| Chapter             | Emotional Quality | Musical Character            |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frozen Stillness    | suspended, cold   | sparse, wide, low movement   |
| Playful Escape      | light, kinetic    | rhythmic curiosity, air      |
| Haunted Realization | inward, fragile   | reduced harmony, tension     |
| Constant Pressure   | anxious, driven   | pulse-forward, narrow        |
| Growing Resolve     | focused, grounded | steady groove, weight        |
| Spiritual Weight    | vast, uncanny     | reverb, slow harmonic motion |
| Grief → Force       | overwhelming      | density, low-end power       |
| Quiet Aftermath     | calm, unresolved  | gentle dissipation           |
